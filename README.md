# CREPL -- A Pattern Library Generator
### Create React Extensible Pattern Library

CREPL bootstraps a purely structural and functional pattern library, providing a commonly used base set of components.
 It's like a cross between [CRA], [Bootstrap], and [Lodash] -- but for creating naked pattern libraries.

*Slogan* :: "The naked pattern library generator! Styles not included..."


#### Orgin of name

CR kinda like [CRA]
Prodounced Creep-ull, like a combination of Creep and People.
If you think about it, it's kinda like a human with only the skeleton (the HTML), some muscles and tendons (JS for actions and events), and a small brain (minimal UI state).
 But no skin (CSS). Just like creepy zombie people! üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Testing ‚úÖ

The foundational test framework is [Jest], with the inclusion of custom [Jest Matchers] to make
assertions about DOM state.

For the testing of the React API, we are using [React Testing Library].
